2. **Guess the Contributor**: Once the playlist is created, players will have to guess **who added each song** by typing in the name of the contributor. If you guess correctly, you earn points!
3. **Track Your Progress**: The app keeps track of how many points you've earned as you successfully guess who added which songs.

## Configuration Process üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with the Spotify Playlist Guessing Game, you need to **authorize** the app to interact with Spotify. Here's how you can set up the app:

### Step 1: Create a Spotify Developer Account
To begin, you need to create an account with **Spotify Developer**:
1. Go to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Sign up or log in with your Spotify account.
3. Once logged in, create a new **Spotify App** by following the instructions provided by Spotify. You will get **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys, which are essential for authorization.

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API
1. In your newly created app on the Spotify Developer dashboard, configure the **Redirect URI**. This is where Spotify will send the user after authorization.
   - Example: `http://localhost:5000/callback`
2. Add this Redirect URI to your **app's Spotify settings** under the "Edit Settings" section.

### Step 3: Authorize Your App
- The game uses the **Spotify Web API** to fetch and manage playlists. To connect your app with Spotify:
  1. Go to the **authorization page**.
  2. Log in to your Spotify account.
  3. Grant the necessary permissions for the app to read your playlists and track data.

### Step 4: Integrate Your Client ID & Client Secret
- In your **backend application** (Flask server), replace the placeholders with your actual **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from the Spotify Developer dashboard.
  ```python
  CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
  CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'
  REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:5000/callback'
